## Autocompletions

If you're using installation from homebrew then you should have working autocompletions upon installation assuming
you've done the [brew general setup](https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-zsh).

If you install the binary manually then you can easily generate autcompletions:

### bash

```
# set up autocomplete in bash into the current shell, bash-completion package should be installed first.
source <(marathon-cloud completions bash)
# add autocomplete permanently to your bash shell.
echo "source <(marathon-cloud completions bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### zsh

```
# set up autocomplete in zsh into the current shell
source <(marathon-cloud completions zsh)
# add autocomplete permanently to your zsh shell
echo '[[ $commands[marathon-cloud] ]] && source <(marathon-cloud completions zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### fish

```
# add marathon-cloud autocompletion permanently to your fish shell
echo 'marathon-cloud completions fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
